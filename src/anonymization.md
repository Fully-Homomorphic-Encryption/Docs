# Anonymization

The goal of anonymization is to anonymize data so that the data could not be associated with any one individual. 

There are two ways to achieve anonymization of data. 
- Data Generalization (achieve k-anonymity and l-diversity): 
  - k-anonymity: General a data property, so that in the group the data belongs to,  at least k-1 individuals who have the same properties. 
  - l-diversity: Anonymized data set for itsâ€™ sensitive attributes. 
- Adding Noise to Data:
   - By adding mathematical noise to data, make it difficult to ascertain whether any one individual is part of a data set.
