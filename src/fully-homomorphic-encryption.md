# Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
=====================================

Homomorphic Encryption cryptosystem is a cryptosystem whose decryption is a morphism. 
```
Decrypt(a*b) = Decrypt(a) * Decrypt(b)
```

Homomorphic Encryption cryptosystem allows operate on ciphertexts without decryption.

It ensures end-to-end semantically secure, which is ensuring security against honest but curious adversaries.
