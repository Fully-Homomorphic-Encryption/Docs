# Privacy Preserving Techniques  

Privacy preserving technique allows sharing sensitive personal information while preserving users' privacy.

There are many Privacy Preserving Techniques:

1. [Anonymization (weakest)](https://github.com/Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption/Docs/blob/main/src/anonymization.md 'Anonymization (weakest)')
2. [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption/PrivacyPreservingTechs/blob/main/src/differentialprivacy.md 'Differential Privacy')
3. [Federated Learning](URL 'Federated Learning')
4. [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://github.com/Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption/Docs/blob/main/src/fully-homomorphic-encryption.md 'Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)')
5. Muti Party Computation (MPC)
6. Confidential Computing through Secure Enclave (e.g. SGX and TrustZone)
